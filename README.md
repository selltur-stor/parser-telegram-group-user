# parser telegram group
 
Here is a parser of users from groups in Telegram.
The program collects user names, their id and tag (if any), and also checks if they have moderator/administrator rights and saves everything in an xlsx file, with the name "group_users"

you will need to create an application in telegram using this link https://my.telegram.org/auth

The program does not collect users if their list is closed by the groups privacy settings
